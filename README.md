# TODO
This repos is in contruction...

The base form is already finished, but this README, test.py and used_packages/ need to be worked on.
Also, some of the python functions are going to be relocated behind a file. So only train/test/registrate are the visible python files.

# I2I-Synthesis
I2I-Synthesis is a Image-to-Image Synthesis repository containing the CycleGAN framework. In addition to the training/testing of networks based on MR/CT/CBCT or natural (RGB) images, this repos also provides a live-on-cam synthesis script in [/demo](https://github.com/nilsFrohwitter/I2I-Synthesis/tree/main/demo).

All of this was created under the work at the [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web).
